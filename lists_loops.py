# Chapter 4 Looping: Iterative actions
# for var_name in list_name:
# for - is loop
# var_names - is a new var you created inside the loop. it's defined only inside the for loop.

# for each loop

for magician in magicians: # this means "for each element in the list"
    print(f'magician: {magician}')
    print(magician, '__________')

    # if you want to repeat some action for one certain element inside the loop,
    # you should create another for loop inside the for loop
    # for a in x:
        # print(a)

# print(abc)  # out of scope, abc should be used only inside the loop not outside
# print('byeee')

# RANGE -------------------------------------------------------------
# range(startingNumber, endingNumber, steps) - ending number not included.
# NOTE: range does not return a list, you need to use list() functions
# to see the result in a list

# range(10, 20, 2) -> 10, 12, 14, 16, 18
# range(5) -> range(0, 5, 1) -> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
# range(16, 21) -> range(16, 21, 1) -> 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

# print(f'range : {list(range(5))}')

print(f'range: {list(range(5))}')
print(f'# # using range in a loop -----------------------')

# # Exercise : create a list of squares of numbers from 101 to 110 (inclusive)
print(f'exercise---------')

square_list = [] # this has 0 elements
# when you need create a list out of unknown data, you need to create empty list, and then append it
for num in range(101, 111):
    result = num ** 2 # **2 is a default for calculating square. could also use num*num here
    print(f'square = {result}')
    square_list.append(result) # then, at the end of loop you append the results to that list
# so the number of elements in this list will be equal to the amount of numbers between
# 101(included) and 111(not included). so from 101 to 110 both included.

y = len(square_list) # shows how many elements now in the list
print('the list has',y, 'elements')
print(square_list)

# list comprehension: another way of making that list with squares:
square_list_2 = [value**2 for value in range(101,111)] # here u have to put value**2 before defining value
for value in square_list_2:
    print('2nd option',value)

# phsuedocode - steps in words not in syntax

# total = total + num  # total += num
# total -= num  # total = total - num
# total *= num  # total = total * num

# lists with both string and integer elements can be sliced

# example with a string list:
ppp = ['fuzz', 'buzz', 'duzz', 'cuzz', 'muzz']
print('this is sliced', ppp[0:3] ) # prints 0 to 3 ['fuzz', 'buzz', 'duzz']
